## Flutter UI Implementation Guide

### How to Implement a UI Design in Flutter:

1. **Study the Design**: Look at the UI design in Figma and understand how it looks.
2. **Copy the Design**: Use Flutter to recreate the design as closely as possible.
3. **Make it Work**: Ensure that all buttons and features work as intended.
4. **Test It**: Try your UI on different devices to make sure it looks good everywhere.
5. **Take Pictures**: Capture screenshots of your UI to show others.
6. **Share Your Work**: Put those screenshots in your README file to show off your creation!
